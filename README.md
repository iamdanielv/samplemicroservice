# Sample Microservice Implementation with GoLang and Docker

This repository contains a sample microservice implementation using GoLang and Docker. It includes both server and client portions, though the client is not yet implemented.

## Code Layout

The code is organized into two main directories:

- `server`: Contains the server logic.
- `client`: Placeholder for client-side code (currently not implemented).

To get started with the server, navigate to the `server` directory and run the following in a terminal:

```sh
make help
```

This command will provide a list of available Make commands to get you started.

## Next Steps
